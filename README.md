Dependencies:

  GLFW: https://github.com/glfw/glfw/
  Vulkan (headers, obv the drivers too): https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
  CGLM: https://github.com/recp/cglm
  You also might need to recompile the static libraries located in the libs folder, directions for doing that can be found here:
    https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html
    https://xkbcommon.org/doc/current/
    
Note for Linux users:
  Most (if not all) of these (depending on your distro) can be installed through the terminal, or some terminal-based app


The goal of this project is to create a neat Vulkan abstraction in C, for whoever may need it, while at the same time, improving my own Vulkan (and C) skills


Do whatever you want with this project I truly do not care
